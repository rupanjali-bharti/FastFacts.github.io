Although there is debate about their actual existence and location, historical accounts suggest that these gardens were an architectural marvel. They featured a series of lush, elevated terraces filled with a variety of plants and trees, irrigated by a complex system of aqueducts. The gardens were thought to have been constructed by King Nebuchadnezzar II for his wife, Amytis, to remind her of the green hills and valleys of her homeland.</p>
