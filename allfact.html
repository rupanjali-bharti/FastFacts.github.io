                    <h1>CAN SPECIES EVER COME BACK?</h1>
                    <p>Occasionally a species considered extinct reappears. Recently a rare gaint turtle believed to be extinct
                        in the wild was found in northern Vietnam. The Swinhoe's soft shelled turtle, which can weigh up to 300 pounds
                        and live fpr more than 100 years, was discovered and photographed by zoologists. A second sighting
                        in southern China has been confirmed, so the species likely has survived a brush with extinction.
                    </p>
                    <p>Bird enthusiasts live in hope of the same outcome for the ivory-billed woodpecker , last photographed in northeastern Louisiana in 1938
                         and last reliably sighted in 1944.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It lived in the southern forests of the United States and the upland pine forests of cuba. It is presumed extinct by 
                        many ornithologists, but sightings in 2004 and 2005 have given bird lovers cause for optimism.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Dinosaurs: Celebrities of Extinction</h1>
                    <p>Dinosaurs dominated life on earth for some 180 million years, from their beginning in the Triassic period 200 million years, from their 
                        beginnings in the Triassic period 200 million years ago until their abrupt exit during the Cretaceous period, more than 65 million years ago.
                        They flourished during the jurassic period ,when there were only two basic continents, but by the beginning of the Cretaceous period , 145 million years ago,
                        they inhabited a seven-continent planet--albeit a warmer and wetter one where many species, both plant and animal were gigantic.

                    <h1>Stars</h1>
                    <p>When we look at stars in the night sky, we are looking
                        back in time. Many stars formed millions, if not billions, of years ago. Furthermore, the starlight that reaches our eyes left those faraway stars some
                        time ago-ranging from a few minutes ago(the sun) to four years ago(Alpha Centauri,the sun's nearest star neighbor)
                        to a much longer time ago(abjects at the edges of our galaxy).
                    </p>
                   <h1>In Stars ,Size Matters</h1>
                   <p>Small stars continue to burn for hundreds of billions
                    of years. The largest star, about a hundred times
                    the mass of the sun ,live shorter lives, burning out after a few
                    million years and dying with a bang. they become exploding 
                    supernovae that may leave behind a remnant of glowing gas.</p>
                    <p>Shock waves from supernovae tend to compress interstellar
                        gas. which may ignite and become a new star: stellar recycling.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Nebulae: Birthplace of stars</h1>
                    <p>Stars are born in an enormous cloud of interstellar dust and hydrogen gas called
                        a nebula. Nebulae represents the building blocks for star , galaxies
                        and planets in te universe.
                    </p>
                    <p>Nebula form when stars die. When the end comes for our sun,
                        for example the end comes for our sun, for example,it's outer layers will heat 
                        ,swell and eventually blow off .The hot, dead core will create a glowing nebula, which will in turn 
                        become a nursery for new stars.

                   <h1>Shapes of Galaxies?</h1>
                   <p> Investigators have collected images of galaxies as far as 10 to 
                    13 billion light year away.A small galaxy can have a diameter of a 
                    few thousand light-years and contain a billion stars or fewer, while a 
                    large galaxy can have a diameter of half a million light-years and contain more  
                    than a trillion stars.</p>
                    <p>Our galaxy, the Milky way, is a medium-size galaxy ,it is estimated to have a diameter 
                        of about 100,000 light years and to contain about 100-400 billion stars.The following are the types of 
                        galaxies:

                   <h1>Mapping the human Genome</h1>
                   <p>The goal of modern genetics has been mapping the 
                    human genome- the detailed structure  of our own 
                    DNA. The effort to do that was largely complete by 2003, yielding a guide 
                    to the more than three billion base pairs of chemicals that compose the rugs if a double helix-shaped ladder 
                    and give the coded instructions for the  manufacture of protein. the human Genome project found that those base pairs make up some 20,000
                    distinct human genes.</p>
                    <p>One new tool ,the HapMap catalog, uses geographially diverse blood samples to trace regional
                        variations in DNA and has led research into the roots of some health problems.

                    <p><h4>FAST FACT:</h4>Scientist estimate that there are about 20,000 genes in the human genome. A yeast genome has about 5,300 genes, and a mouse's genome has about 23,000.</p>

                   <p>A close relative of the spider and not a crab at all ,the horseshoe crab bears a long lineage. Vestiges of similar animals date back 200 million years ago 
                    horseshoe crabs have hinged bodies, a horseshoe shaped  head, and a long tail-spine . They can grow up to two feet long. They live on the east coasts of Asia 
                    and North America. 
                   </p>
                   <p>Horseshoe crabs feed on true crabs, mollusks, worms, and other prey. they swim along the ocean floor and can also travel along the mud by pulling up their 
                    body and pushing with the spine and rear legs.
                   </p>
                   <p>Spring tides bring horseshoe crabs onto the land by the thousands. Females scoop out depressions in the sand and fill them with hundreds of eggs. Males follow and cover the egg with sperm. within several weeks
                    tiny hatchings, about an eight of an inch long, wash out to sea with the tide to complete their life cycle.
