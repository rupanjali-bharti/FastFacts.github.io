                    <h1>SHAPES OF GALAXIES?</h1>
                    <p>The universe contains more than 125 billion galaxies, immense aggregations of stars, gas, dust and the 
                        dark matter bound by their own gravity. Galaxies vary in size, luminosity, and mass. The largest are a million times brighter than the faintest.
                        Galaxies take one of three primary shapes :elliptical,spiral and irregular.
                    </p>

                    <p>Many galaxy name starts with M followed by a number. This naming tradition began in 1730-1817 by a French astronomer Charles Joseph Messier.
                        Our solar system resides in an arm of Milky Way, a spiral galaxy some 100,000 light years long from end to end. Our sun and planets revolve once around 
                        the center of the Milky Way every 250 million years.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Milky Way belongs to a cluster called the Local Group , which contain the Andromeda and M33 galaxies as well as about 35 dwarf galaxies.
                        The cluster's diameter is more than 10 million light year, which means our neighbour in the Local Group are million of light years from the Milky Way .
                    </p>
                    <h3>THE MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES OF GALAXIES:</h3>
                    <p>1. THE SPIRAL GALAXY: has older red stars in its center, younger blue ones in its arms.</p>
                    <p>2. AN ELLIPTICAL GALAXY: this giant was formed when two gas-rich galaxies merged.</p>
                    <p>3. STARBUST GALAXY: messier 82 includes a blue disk and glowing red pulmes of hydrogen.</p>
                    <p>4. A BARRED SPIRAL GALAXY: near the Miliky Way includes starforming clouds and banda of dust.</p>

                    <h3>FAST FACT: LIGHT FROM THE CENTER OF THE MILIKY WAY TAKES 25,000 YEARS TO RECH US ON EARTH</h3>
